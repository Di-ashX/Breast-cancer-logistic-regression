# Breast-cancer-logistic-regression

The contents of this repo will follow the outline below:

    The Data - Exploratory Data Analysis
    The Variables - Feature Selection
    The Model - Building a Logistic Regression Model
    The Prediction - Making Predictions with the Model


Attribute Information:

    id
    diagnosis: M = malignant, B = benign

Columns 3 to 32

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

    radius: distances from center to points on the perimeter
    texture: standard deviation of gray-scale values
    perimeter
    area
    smoothness: local variation in radius lengths
    compactness: perimeter^2 / area - 1.0
    concavity: severity of concave portions of the contour
    concave points: number of concave portions of the contour
    symmetry
    fractal dimension: "coastline approximation" - 1
